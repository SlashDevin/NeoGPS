// First, some background information.  There are two kinds of NMEA sentences:
//
// 1. Standard NMEA sentences begin with "$ttccc", where
//      "tt" is the talker ID, and
//      "ccc" is the variable-length sentence type (i.e., command).
//
//    For example, "$GPGLL,..." is a GLL sentence (Geographic Lat/Long)
//    transmitted by talker "GP".  This is the most common talker ID.  Some
//    devices may report "$GNGLL,..." when a mix of GPS and non-GPS
//    satellites have been used to determine the GLL data.
//
// 2. Proprietary NMEA sentences (i.e., those unique to a particular
//    manufacturer) begin with "$Pmmmccc", where
//      "P" is the NMEA-defined prefix indicator for proprietary messages,
//      "mmm" is the 3-character manufacturer ID, and
//      "ccc" is the variable-length sentence type (it can be empty).
//
// No validation of manufacturer ID and talker ID is performed in this
// base class.  For example, although "GP" is a common talker ID, it is not
// guaranteed to be transmitted by your particular device, and it IS NOT
// REQUIRED.  If you need validation of these IDs, or you need to use the
// extra information provided by some devices, you have two independent
// options:
//
// 1. Enable SAVING the ID: When /decode/ returns DECODE_COMPLETED, the
// /talker_id/ and/or /mfr_id/ members will contain ID bytes.  The entire
// sentence will be parsed, perhaps modifying members of /fix/.  You should
// enable one or both IDs if you want the information in all sentences *and*
// you also want to know the ID bytes.  This adds two bytes of RAM for the
// talker ID, and 3 bytes of RAM for the manufacturer ID.
//
// 2. Enable PARSING the ID:  The virtual /parse_talker_id/ and
// /parse_mfr_id/ will receive each ID character as it is parsed.  If it
// is not a valid ID, return /false/ to abort processing the rest of the
// sentence.  No CPU time will be wasted on the invalid sentence, and no
// /fix/ members will be modified.  You should enable this if you want to
// ignore some IDs.  You must override /parse_talker_id/ and/or
// /parse_mfr_id/ in a derived class.

//  Becase the NMEA checksum is not very good at error detection, you can
//    choose to enable additional validity checks.  This trades a little more
//    code and execution time for more reliability.
//
//  Validation at the character level is a syntactic check only.  For
//    example, integer fields must contain characters in the range 0..9,
//    latitude hemisphere letters can be 'N' or 'S'.  Characters that are not
//    valid for a particular field will cause the entire sentence to be
//    rejected as an error, *regardless* of whether the checksum would pass.
#define NMEAGPS_VALIDATE_CHARS false

//    example, latitude degrees must be in the range -90..+90.

//    checksum would pass.
#define NMEAGPS_VALIDATE_FIELDS false

//------------------------------------------------------
// Some devices may omit trailing commas at the end of some
// sentences.  This may prevent the last field from being
// parsed correctly, because the parser for some types keep
// the value in an intermediate state until the complete
// field is received (e.g., parseDDDMM, parseFloat and
// parseZDA).
//
// Enabling this will inject a simulated comma when the end
// of a sentence is received and the last field parser
// indicated that it still needs one.

#define NMEAGPS_COMMA_NEEDED

//  Some applications may want to recognize a sentence type
//  without actually parsing any of the fields.  Uncommenting
//  this define will allow the nmeaMessage member to be set

// If you need to know the exact UTC time at *any* time,
//   not just after a fix arrives, you must calculate the
//   offset between the Arduino micros() clock and the UTC
//   time in a received fix.  There are two ways to do this:
//
// 1) When the GPS quiet time ends and the new update interval begins.
//    The timestamp will be set when the first character (the '$') of
//    the new batch of sentences arrives from the GPS device.  This is fairly
//    accurate, but it will be delayed from the PPS edge by the GPS device's
//    fix calculation time (usually ~100us).  There is very little variance
//    in this calculation time (usually < 30us), so all timestamps are
//    delayed by a nearly-constant amount.
//
//    NOTE:  At update rates higher than 1Hz, the updates may arrive with
//    some increasing variance.

//#define NMEAGPS_TIMESTAMP_FROM_INTERVAL

// 2) From the PPS pin of the GPS module.  It is up to the application
//    developer to decide how to capture that event.  For example, you could:
//
//    a) simply poll for it in loop and call UTCsecondStart(micros());
//    b) use attachInterrupt to call a Pin Change Interrupt ISR to save
//       the micros() at the time of the interrupt (see NMEAGPS.h), or
//    c) connect the PPS to an Input Capture pin.  Set the
//       associated TIMER frequency, calculate the elapsed time
//       since the PPS edge, and add that to the current micros().
